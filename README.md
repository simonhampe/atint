## What is a-tint? 

a-tint is an extension for polymake (see [their webpage](http://www.polymake.org) for more info). It aims to implement algorithmic aspects of tropical intersection theory. Tropical varieties are realized as weighted polyhedral complexes.
This project is part of and financed by the [DFG Priority Project SPP 1489](http://www.computeralgebra.de/index).

**Current version:** 2.0

**Important note:** As of polymake 2.15-beta3 a-tint is a bundled extension! I.e. if you download the newest perpetual beta or release, a-tint is already included!

## Getting started 

You can find a user manual in the [wiki pages](https://github.com/simonhampe/atint/wiki), as well as installation instructions and a list of features.

**Important note:** You will need a recent version of polymake (Release 3.0, preferably) to run a-tint.
