## What is a-tint? 

a-tint is an application for polymake (see [their webpage](http://www.polymake.org) for more info). It aims to implement algorithmic aspects of tropical intersection theory. Tropical varieties are realized as weighted polyhedral complexes.
This project is part of and financed by the [DFG Priority Project SPP 1489](http://www.computeralgebra.de/index).
