  @brief Takes  as input a tropical fan / tropical variety and an array of rational values.

Missing values will be filled up by 0's, superfluous ones will be ignored. The function will then compute the corresponding Weil divisor and return it as a tropical variety given as a fan. The fan uses homogeneous coordinates, if and only the input fan does.
