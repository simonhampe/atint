# @topic category any/Intersection theory
# These are general +++ related to intersection theory.

# @topic category any/Defining morphisms and functions
# These +++ are used to define morphisms or rational functions on a Cycle.

# @topic category any/Local computations
# These +++ are used for doing computations locally around a specified part of a Cycle.

# @topic category any/Creation functions for specific cycles
# These +++ are special +++ for creating special tropical cycles.

# @topic category any/Basic polyhedral operations
# These +++ provide basic functionality related to polyhedral geometry, but not
# necessarily to tropical geometry

# @topic category any/Divisor computation
# These +++ deal with the computation of divisors

# @topic category any/Degeneracy tests
# These +++ test cycles for degeneracy, i.e. whether a cycle is the empty cycle

# @topic category any/Abstract rational curves
# These +++ deal with abstract rational n-marked curves.

# @topic category any/Moduli of rational curves
# These +++ deal with moduli spaces of abstract or parametrized rational curves.

# @topic category any/Matroids
# These +++ deal with matroids and matroidal fans.

# @topic category any/Lattices
# These +++ deal with lattices (meaning free abelian, finitely generated groups).

# @topic category any/Morphisms
# These are general +++ that deal with morphisms and their arithmetic.
