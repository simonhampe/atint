# FIXME: Documentation for extensions? 
# a-tint is an application for polymake (see [[http://polymake.mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de]]). 
# It aims to implement algorithmic aspects of tropical intersection theory. 
# Tropical varieties are realized as weighted polyhedral complexes. This project is part of and
# financed by the DFG Priority Project SPP 1489 (see also [[http://www.computeralgebra.de/index.php]])
# For more information see [[https://github.com/simonhampe/atint]]
