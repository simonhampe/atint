# a-tint is an application for polymake (see [[http://polymake.mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de]]). 
# It aims to implement algorithmic aspects of tropical intersection theory. 
# Tropical varieties are realized as weighted polyhedral complexes. This project is part of and
# financed by the DFG Priority Project SPP 1489 (see also [[http://www.computeralgebra.de/index.php]])
# For more information see [[https://github.com/simonhampe/atint]]

# A rational function on a polyhedral complex. It can be described by giving its [[DOMAIN]],
# a Cycle, and values on this domain - which are encoded in the properties [[VERTEX_VALUES]] and 
# [[LINEALITY_VALUES]].
# Alternatively, it can be defined by a tropical quotient of homogeneous tropical polynomials of the 
# same degree i.e. by giving [[NUMERATOR]] and [[DENOMINATOR]]. 
# A [[DOMAIN]] can be defined additionally (though one should take
# care that both functions are actually piecewise affine linear on the cells), otherwise it will be
# computed as the common refinement of the domains of affine linearity of the two polynomials.
# Note: This has nothing to do with common's RationalFunction (which is univariate). If you want to 
# access that type or use this type from another application, be sure to prepend the appropriate 
# namespace identifier.
declare object RationalFunction<Addition>;

# A morphism is a function between cycles which is locally affine linear and respects the lattices.
# It is defined by a [[DOMAIN]], which is a cycle, and values on this domain, [[VERTEX_VALUES]] and
# [[LINEALITY_VALUES]], much like [[RationalFunction]].
# Alternatively, it can be defined as a global affine linear function by giving a matrix and a 
# translation vector.
declare object Morphism<Addition>;

# An n-marked rational curve, identified by its [[SETS]], i.e. its partitions of {1,...,n} and
# its [[COEFFICIENTS]], i.e. the lengths of the corresponding edges.
declare object RationalCurve;

# This represents the result of the method [[lines_in_cubic]]. It contains:
# The tropical polynomial representing the surface, the surface itself as a Cycle and 
# lists of lines and families of different types, each starting with LIST_... 
# 
# The object also has methods, starting with array_... that return the corresponding LIST_... as a perl array.
# The different (lists of) lines can be visualized nicely with [[visualize_in_surface]].
# FIXME: I think this only works for Max at the moment?
