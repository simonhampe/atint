# This file contains some tropical objects that take rather long to 
# compute

diag_u_*_*.tar.gz: 
	Used by the script atint_diagonals. Contains functions 
	that cut out the diagonal in B(U_*_*)
moduli9/moduli10: 
	The tropical moduli spaces M_0,9 and M_0,10. M_0,10 has been
	tar-gzipped since the actual file is 90 MB large (and takes
	around 3 min to load into polymake). untar with 
	"tar -xzvf moduli10.atint.tar.gz"
