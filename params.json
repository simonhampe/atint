{"name":"a-tint","tagline":"A polymake extension for tropical intersection theory","body":"## What is a-tint? \r\n\r\na-tint is an application for polymake (see [their webpage](http://www.polymake.org) for more info). It aims to implement algorithmic aspects of tropical intersection theory. Tropical varieties are realized as weighted polyhedral complexes.\r\nThis project is part of and financed by the [DFG Priority Project SPP 1489](http://www.computeralgebra.de/index).\r\n\r\n## Getting started \r\n\r\nYou can find a user manual in the [wiki pages](https://github.com/simonhampe/atint/wiki), as well as installation instructions and a list of features.\r\n\r\n**Important note:** You will need a recent version of polymake (perpetual beta, preferably) to run a-tint. \r\n## More credit \r\n\r\na-tint also contains code by:\r\n\r\n* Dennis Diefenbach\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
